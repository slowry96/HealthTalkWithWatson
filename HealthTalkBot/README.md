This is a simple web page app to communicate with that
college student who is not feeling to well. He/She doesn't
want to call their mom to hear how they should be taking
better care of themselves, but can turn to HealthTalkWithWatson
for positive advice instead!

To run, go to the public DIR and run index.html.
It should lead you to a page with a chat box in
the middle. Tell it hi and how you are feeling right.
(spefically sicknesses currently)
